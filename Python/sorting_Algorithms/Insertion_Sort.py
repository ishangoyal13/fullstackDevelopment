THIS IS HOW IT WORKS
# Mark the first element, 10, as sorted
[10, 3, 2, 6]
# Look at next element, 3, 3 < 10
[10, 3, 2, 6]
# Extract 3 and move it before 10, mark first element, 3 as sorted
[3, 10, 2, 6]
# Look at the next unsorted element, 2, 2 < 10, 2 < 3
[3, 10, 2, 6]
# Extract 2 and move it before 3, mark first element, 2, as sorted
[2, 3, 10, 6]
# Look at the next unsorted element, 6, 6 < 10, 6 > 3
[2, 3, 10, 6]
# Extract 6 and move it before 10
[2, 3, 6, 10]
